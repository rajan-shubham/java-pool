        Types of graphs
        1. Undirected graphs
        2. Directed graphs

        nodes or vertices
        horizontal line -> undirected edge
        u -- v means u --> v and u <-- v
                           directed edge
        u <-- v means you can go to u form v but not v from u

        cyclic graph and acyclic graph
            undirected or directed graph

        Path --> Contains a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable
            In a path the adjacent nodes must have edges between them and also contain unique nodes

        Degree of a node (undirected graph)
            total no. of edges are attached to it

        PROPERTY: Total Degree of a graph == 2 * Edges

        Directed Graph -> Indegree and Outdegree of a node

        Edge Weight -> any assigned weights of edges (if weights not assigned default = 1)
